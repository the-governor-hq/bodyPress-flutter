## Why BodyPress?

Most health apps show dashboards of numbers. BodyPress takes a different approach: it presents your biometrics as a _narrative_. Story-framing surfaces correlations you'd otherwise miss — poor sleep preceding an elevated resting heart rate, high AQI days correlating with fewer steps — and reading about yourself is more engaging than staring at charts.

Under the hood the app treats the human body as an observable system: collect objective signals throughout the day, feed them to an LLM, and get back a warm, first-person journal entry that reads as though your body is writing to you.

## Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Journal**           | Daily narrative generated from real sensor data — headline, mood, summary, full body text. Written in first-person ("your body speaking to you").                                                                                       |
| **Smart Refresh**        | Persisted entries return instantly. AI runs only when new unprocessed captures exist. No redundant sensor reads or API calls.                                                                                                           |
| **Background Captures**  | WorkManager-based periodic data collection with quiet-hour and battery-awareness support.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Manual Capture**       | On-demand snapshot with toggleable data sources (health, environment, location, calendar, BLE HR device).                                                                                                                               |
| **BLE Heart Rate**       | Real-time streaming from any Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Profile (0x180D) device — Polar H10, Wahoo TICKR, Garmin straps, etc. Live ECG-style waveform displayed in the Capture screen. Snapshot BPM auto-attached to each capture. |
| **Cardiovascular Depth** | Resting heart rate and HRV (SDNN) read from HealthKit / Health Connect alongside average HR. All three are included in daily snapshots and AI prompts.                                                                                  |
| **Patterns & Trends**    | AI-derived insights aggregated from capture history — energy distribution, recurring themes, notable signals, recent moments timeline.                                                                                                  |
| **User Annotations**     | Free-text notes and mood emojis per day, persisted in SQLite alongside the AI-generated content.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Onboarding**           | Step-by-step permission flow with per-permission explanations and privacy notes. Every step is skippable.                                                                                                                               |
| **Dark & Light Themes**  | Material 3 theming with system-mode detection.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Data Sources

| Domain             | Sensor / API                        | What's read                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Movement**       | Health Connect / HealthKit          | Steps, distance, calories, workouts                        |
| **Cardiovascular** | Optical HR sensor (OS health store) | Average HR, resting HR, HRV (SDNN)                         |
| **Cardiovascular** | BLE HR strap (direct, 0x180D)       | Live BPM stream + RR intervals — no OS sync needed         |
| **Sleep**          | Device sleep tracking               | Duration, phases                                           |
| **Environment**    | GPS → ambient-scan API              | Temperature, humidity, AQI, UV, pressure, wind, conditions |
| **Schedule**       | Device calendar (CalDAV)            | Today's events                                             |
| **Location**       | GPS (Geolocator)                    | Coordinates — ephemeral, never stored                      |

> **Privacy:** GPS is read once to fetch environmental data, then discarded. No location history is recorded or transmitted. Health data is read-only — the app never writes to HealthKit or Health Connect.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK **≥ 3.9.2**
- **iOS:** Xcode 14+, deployment target iOS 14+
- **Android:** SDK 21+ (Android 5.0), Health Connect app for health data on Android 13+

### Install & run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run

# Or use the helper scripts
.\dev.ps1           # Windows (PowerShell)
./dev.sh            # macOS / Linux
```

### Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API key:

```
AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Platform configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>iOS</strong></summary>

`Info.plist` keys are pre-configured:

- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` / `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`
- `NSCalendarsUsageDescription`
- `NSMotionUsageDescription`
- `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` ← BLE heart rate devices
- `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription`

Enable HealthKit capability in Xcode: **Runner** target → **Signing & Capabilities** → **+ HealthKit**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Android</strong></summary>

`AndroidManifest.xml` includes permissions for location, Health Connect (including `READ_HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY`), activity recognition, calendar, and BLE:

- `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` (API ≤ 30 legacy)
- `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` (`neverForLocation`) + `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` (API 31+)
- `android.hardware.bluetooth_le` feature declaration (`required=false` — app installs on non-BLE devices)

The Health Connect app is required on Android 13+ for HR, resting HR, and HRV data.

### Key Domain Types

| Type                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BodyBlogEntry`     | Immutable day record: headline, summary, full text, mood, tags, user note, `aiGenerated` flag, raw `BodySnapshot`.                                                                                                                 |
| `BodySnapshot`      | Flat struct of every collected metric for one day: steps, calories, distance, sleep, `avgHeartRate`, `restingHeartRate`, `hrv`, workouts, environmental data, calendar events. Serialisation-ready for persistence and AI prompts. |
| `BleHrReading`      | Single BLE HR measurement: `bpm` + `rrMs` list (RR intervals in ms for real-time HRV). Emitted by `BleHeartRateService`.                                                                                                           |
| `CaptureEntry`      | Point-in-time snapshot (health + env + location + calendar). Carries `isProcessed` / `processedAt` for the refresh pipeline, plus optional `CaptureAiMetadata`.                                                                    |
| `CaptureAiMetadata` | AI-derived per-capture metadata: summary, themes, energy level, mood assessment, tags, notable signals. Stored as JSON in the `captures` table (schema v7).                                                                        |
| `JournalAiResult`   | Parsed AI output: headline, summary, full body, mood, mood emoji, tags.                                                                                                                                                            |

### Provider Architecture

All services are exposed as `Provider<T>` singletons via `service_providers.dart`. Screens consume them with `ref.read(someServiceProvider)`, which guarantees a single SQLite connection, makes every service replaceable in tests, and eliminates scattered state.

## How the AI Journal Works

### Smart Refresh Pipeline

```
getTodayEntry()                       ← called on every Journal visit

  ├─ INCREMENTAL  — persisted entry exists, N unprocessed captures

```

### Capture → Journal Flow

1. `CaptureService` (manual) or `BackgroundCaptureService` (WorkManager) creates a capture.
2. Each starts with `is_processed = 0`.
3. `getTodayEntry()` detects unprocessed captures → runs AI only when needed.
4. On success, `markCapturesProcessed()` flips the flag.
5. Next visit → zero unprocessed → instant return from cache.

### AI Details

- **Endpoint:** `POST ai.governor-hq.com`
- **System prompt:** First-person voice — "the body speaking to its person." Warm, poetic, data-grounded. Never clinical, never medical advice.
- **Context window:** 7-day rolling history fed into every prompt (`ContextWindowService`).
- **Fallback:** On timeout (45 s) or parse error, the local template entry is returned unchanged.
- **`aiGenerated` flag:** Persisted in SQLite so the ✦ badge survives restarts.
- **`regenerateWithAi(date)`:** Force a fresh AI pass for any date from the journal detail screen.

### Mood Inference (v1 — Heuristic)

```
sleep ≥ 7 h  AND  steps ≥ 5 000  AND  HR > 0   →  energised
sleep < 5 h                                       →  tired
steps ≥ 8 000                                     →  active
AQI > 100                                         →  cautious
sleep ≥ 7 h                                       →  rested
steps = 0  AND  calories = 0                      →  quiet
default                                           →  calm
```

Will be replaced by a classifier or LLM prompt once sufficient labelled data exists.

| --- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Onboarding**     | `/onboarding`       | Permission flow — location, health, calendar. Every step skippable.                                                                                                                                                            |

## Development

### Day-to-day

```bash
flutter analyze          # static analysis — must pass with zero errors
flutter test             # run the test suite
dart format lib/         # format everything
flutter test --coverage  # generate coverage/lcov.info
```

Hot reload: `r` · Hot restart: `R` · Quit: `q`

### Journal Pipeline Layers

Understanding these three layers prevents accidental slowdowns:

| Layer         | File                      | Responsibility                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Persistence   | `local_db_service.dart`   | SQLite CRUD for entries, captures, settings     |
| Orchestration | `body_blog_service.dart`  | Smart refresh, sensor collection, AI enrichment |
| AI            | `journal_ai_service.dart` | Prompt building, API call, JSON parsing         |

**Key rule:** `getTodayEntry()` is called on every Journal visit. The fast path (persisted entry + zero unprocessed captures) must return with no I/O beyond two DB queries.

### Adding a New Service

1. Create `lib/core/services/your_service.dart`.
2. Expose a Riverpod `Provider<YourService>` in `service_providers.dart`.
3. Wire into `BodyBlogService` or the relevant feature screen.

### Adding a New Feature Screen

1. Create `lib/features/your_feature/screens/your_screen.dart`.
2. Add a route in `lib/core/router/app_router.dart`.
3. For a top-level tab, add a `StatefulShellBranch` to the shell route.

### Database Migrations

Schema version lives in `local_db_service.dart` (`_schemaVersion`, currently **7**).

1. Bump `_schemaVersion`.
2. Add an `if (oldVersion < N)` block in `_onUpgrade()`.
3. Wrap `ALTER TABLE` statements in try/catch for duplicate-column safety (hot-restart resilience).

### Testing on Emulators

| Data source      | Emulator / test setup                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Health (Android) | Install Health Connect, add test data manually                                                                                                   |
| Health (iOS)     | Physical device required — HealthKit unavailable in Simulator                                                                                    |
| Location         | Set coordinates via emulator extended controls                                                                                                   |
| Calendar         | Add events in the device calendar app                                                                                                            |
| Environment      | Requires valid GPS to query ambient-scan API                                                                                                     |
| BLE HR           | Physical BLE device required — Bluetooth is unavailable in Android Emulator & iOS Simulator. Use a Polar H10, Wahoo TICKR, or any 0x180D device. |

All data fetches have 5–15 s timeouts. The app shows zero/empty states for unavailable sensors — never fake data (see `CODING_PRINCIPLES.md`).

### Pre-commit Checklist

- [ ] `flutter pub get` — no unresolved deps
- [ ] `dart format lib/` — formatter applied
- [ ] `flutter analyze` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- [ ] `flutter test` — all green
- [ ] New screens wired in `app_router.dart`
- [ ] README architecture tree & screen list updated
- [ ] Roadmap checkbox ticked if feature was shipped
- [ ] No fake data

---

## Principles

- **No fake data.** Sensor unavailable → zero or null, never a plausible placeholder.
- **No location tracking.** GPS read once for the environment fetch, then discarded.
- **Read-only health access.** Never writes to HealthKit or Health Connect.
- **Graceful degradation.** Every data fetch has a timeout. The app never freezes waiting for a sensor.

These are enforced by `CODING_PRINCIPLES.md`.
